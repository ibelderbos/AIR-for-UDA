Implementation of research 'Adversarial Instance Re-weighting for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation', a research project performed at ING Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics.

# Abstract
In classical machine learning, we assume a model trained on the source domain generalizes well to the unlabeled target domain. However, oftentimes we encounter a distribution shift, causing the trained model to be unable to generalize well to the new task. Unsupervised domain adaptation is focused on this transfer of domain knowledge utilizing the available information in the target data. Recent advances in this field have addressed the issue in a feature-based manner, but the integration with instance re-weighting has not yet been explored. This work introduces a non-generative adversarial framework which is inspired by the Wasserstein GAN, and aims at matching the two distributions sample-wise. We first explore the potential and limits of the method on small domain shifts in several proof-of-concepts. Subsequently, we combine the concept with a feature-based network and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art. We conclude that the framework is able to match the distributions under small domain shift, as well as being advantageous for larger domain shifts in imbalanced cases.
